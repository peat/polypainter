# PolyPainter

PolyPainter attempts to recreate a given image using the randomized placement of colored polygons. The polygons are created according to configurable rules about colors, size, transparency, and shape.

The goal of PolyPainter is *not* to create an optimized representation of the source image, but rather to provide a very configurable system for creating interesting (dare we say beautiful) representations. Half the fun of creating an image is watching it render in real time!

Right now this is _super extremely crazy early_ software that I've been hacking on in my spare time for personal use. Please hit me up on Twitter (@peat) if you have any questions at all. :)

Cheers,
