# PolyPainter

PolyPainter attempts to recreate a given image using the randomized placement of colored polygons.

The polygons are created according to rules, but placed randomly on an empty canvas. As the canvas fills, it is compared to the target image, and retains the polygons that increase the fidelity of the image.

The goal of the game is to discover the best rules for generating polygons for recreating an image.
