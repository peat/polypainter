# PolyPainter

PolyPainter attempts to recreate a given image using the randomized placement of colored polygons.

The polygons are created according to rules, but placed randomly on an empty canvas. As the canvas fills, it is compared to the target image, and retains the polygons that increase the fidelity of the image.

The goal of PolyPainter is *not* to create an optimized representation of the source image, but rather to provide a very configurable system for creating interesting (dare we say beautiful) representations.

Right now this is _super extremely crazy early_ software that I've been hacking on in my spare time for personal use. Please hit me up on Twitter if you have any questions at all. :)
